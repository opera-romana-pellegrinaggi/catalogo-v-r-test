Here each room you visit has frescoed vaults, magnificent ceilings, fine tapestries, and paintings by great masters. You can also find fine antique furniture, for example in the private Papal apartment. This visit is an opportunity to experience and learn about both the history of the Church and that of the city of Rome. Quite a bit to appreciate from the Lateran Palace!"

Take a journey through faith and devotion. As objects of devotion, the icons have been carried in procession, invoked for healing, and still today are a living memory of Mary, Mother of us all, and of Jesus, son of God and son of Mary. At Santa Maria in via Lata, we will remember Saint Luke who dwelled there, and who was the first iconographer in history. At Santa Maria in Aracoeli, we will invoke the Madonna Advocata. At Santa Francesca Romana we will pay homage to the oldest known marian icon, “Our Lady of Comfort”. And last but not least, we will meet the patroness of Rome, Mary “Salus Populi Romani” in the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, whom the Popes themselves greet before and after their journeys abroad."
