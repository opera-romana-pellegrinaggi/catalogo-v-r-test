Already in the second century, the community had settled between Trastevere and the opposite bank, where the Ghetto was established in the 16th century. A corner of the Eternal City where the most important memories of the Roman Jewish tradition are preserved. In the Portico of Octavia we remember the Roman period, in Piazza delle Cinque Scole the synagogues the rituals of which were forged by Jews from different countries, and in front of the Great Temple we witness the vitality of today's community. We will see traces of the forced isolation that this community suffered under the Nazi-fascist persecution. A thought provoking journey that calls to mind dramatic and painful stages of history."
